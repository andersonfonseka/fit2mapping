A traceability tool between features (using FODA notation) and core assets artifacts (requirements, A&D and source code).

Main features are:

- Feature model (stakeholders, features, relationships â€“ mandatory, alternative, optional, XOR and OR group -  and associations) .

- Requirement model (actor, requirements and relationships) similar to use case diagram from RUP.

- Mapping model (associating requirements, components to feature elements)

- Traceability matrix and feature selection tree.

- Multiple views support to feature model diagram.
